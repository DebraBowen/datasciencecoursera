## This project uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. </br>
In particular, the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” with readings from Feb 1, 2007 and Feb 2, 2007 were used.

•	Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb] </br>
•	Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a 
one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and	
some sub-metering values are included. </br>
### Data was downloaded November 25, 2016 8:34:29 AM EST
###The following descriptions of the 9 variables dataset are taken from the UCI web site:</br>

<ol> 1. Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </ol>

<ol> 2.	Time: time in format hh:mm:ss </ol>

<ol> 3.	Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)</ol>

<ol> 4.	Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in 	kilowatt) </ol>

<ol> 5.	Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </ol>

<ol> 6.	Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </ol>

<ol> 7.	Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy).It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).</ol>
	
<ol> 8.	Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy).
It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.</ol>

<ol> 9.	Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy).
It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.</ol>
